# Keylogger-Based-Steganography-for-Parental-Control-in-Child-Monitoring

In today’s digital age, parental concerns about their children’s online activities
have grown significantly. With children spending more time online, it has become
imperative for parents to ensure their safety and well-being in the digital realm. This
paper introduces a novel approach to parental control through the integration of
keyloggers and steganography, aimed at enhancing parents’ ability to monitor and
protect their children online. Keyloggers are discreetly embedded in a child’s device
to record keystrokes, including passwords and chat messages, providing parents with
valuable insights into their child’s online interactions. However, traditional keyloggers
raise ethical and privacy concerns. To address these issues, we propose a keylogger-
based steganography technique that conceals the captured data within innocuous
files or images, ensuring privacy while enabling parental oversight. Our research
involves the development of a sophisticated software tool that seamlessly integrates
keyloggers and steganography algorithms. Parents can remotely access the recorded
data through a secure portal, allowing them to monitor their child’s online activity
without infringing on their privacy rights
